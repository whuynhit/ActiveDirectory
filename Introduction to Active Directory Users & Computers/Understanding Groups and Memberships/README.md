# Understanding Groups and Memberships

### In Domain Users, we can create a new group.

### For demonstration purposes, I named it "Sales." And left Group Scope to Global and Group type to Security.

### Open properties for the new group.

### In the members tab, we can add a new member to the Sales group.

### For this demonstration, I chose added the user Jason Bourne to the Sales group.

### In the "Member of" tab, I have added Administrators.

### The Sales group is now a member of Administrators.
![GM](https://github.com/whuynhit/ActiveDirectory/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Active%20Directory%20Users%20%26%20Computers/Understanding%20Groups%20and%20Memberships/sub/7.png)
### From the Jason Bourne user properties, we can see that the user profile is now part of the Sales group.

### If we search for Administrators, we can see who are its members. Here, you can also see that Sales group is a member of Administrators from an earlier demonstration.

### In the Administrators' properties, we can also remove Sales from the list of members.
![GM](https://github.com/whuynhit/ActiveDirectory/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Active%20Directory%20Users%20%26%20Computers/Understanding%20Groups%20and%20Memberships/sub/10.png)
### And now the Sales group is no longer a member of object.
